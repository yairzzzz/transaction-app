📚 About This Project
This project was originally a task given to a friend during a job interview. I decided to take it on as a personal challenge to test my own skills, deepen my understanding of full-stack development, and push my limits as a developer.

I learned a lot throughout the process — from setting up authentication and clean UI state management to implementing dynamic table editing and filtering — and I genuinely enjoyed building this app.
